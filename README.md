Employee Management System (EMS) Overview
An Employee Management System (EMS) is a software tool used by businesses to manage and organize employee-related information. This system helps companies store and track crucial details about employees, such as their contact information, job roles, performance, and payroll. By centralizing this data, EMS ensures efficient employee management and supports smooth day-to-day business operations.

Tech Stack for Employee Management System (EMS)
Framework: ASP.NET 8

A robust web framework by Microsoft, ASP.NET 8 allows you to build fast, secure, and scalable web applications and APIs. It provides all the tools needed to develop high-performance systems for managing employee data.
Database: SQL Server

SQL Server is a relational database management system used to store all employee-related data, such as names, positions, and payroll details. It can handle complex queries efficiently, making it ideal for managing large datasets.
Data Access: Dapper

Dapper is a lightweight, high-performance Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET. It simplifies the process of working with databases by mapping query results to objects, and it's known for being faster and more efficient than other ORMs.
Web API: RESTful APIs

RESTful APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with the backend database and manage employee data. These APIs allow the frontend or mobile applications to send and receive data from the server.
Note:

While PUT is typically used to update data, in some cases, GET and POST can also be used to handle updates and data retrieval.
CRUD Operations in EMS
In this Employee Management System, we implement CRUD operations to manage employee data:

Create (POST) – Adds a new employee to the system.
Read (GET) – Retrieves details of employees from the database.
Update (POST) – Updates existing employee information (in this case, POST is used to update).
Delete (DELETE) – Deletes employee records from the system.
By using these core CRUD operations, the system enables efficient and flexible management of employee data. The tech stack ensures that data is processed quickly, securely, and accurately across all functions.
